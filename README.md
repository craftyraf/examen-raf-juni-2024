# Project: examen-raf-juni-2024
- Name student: Raf Mesotten
- GitHUB repository: https://github.com/craftyraf/examen-raf-juni-2024
- Project date: 2024-06-04 and 2024-06-11

### Set up your virtual environment
- Import 'environment.yml' (in the same folder as 'README.md'), e.g. with Anaconda Navigator -> Environments -> Import
- Start -> Anaconda Powershell Prompt -> typ: "conda activate environment" (in case 'environment' is the name of the environment you just imported)
- Next, still in Anaconda Powershell Prompt, typ: "jupyter notebook", in order to open jupyter notebook.

### Run the notebooks to test the project
- You can find the notebooks 'examen_deel1' and 'examen_deel2' in the subfolder 'notebooks' of the project folder.
- 'examen_deel1' contains the notebook as it was submitted. This part was also included in 'exam_deel2', but revised.

### The scripts that are used by the notebook:
- read_data.py is a script with a function that reads csv files in a folder and concatenates them to a dataframe
- outliers.py is a script with functions that calculates and handles outliers
- make_a_chart.py is a script with functions that generate and/or plot graphs

### Problems with running the notebook? To get an idea of what I did, you can take a look at:
- An HTML file of the notebooks in the folder 'notebooks'
- The scripts in the folder 'scripts'. I provided each function with a docstring.
- In case something isn't clear: contact me via email.

### You can ignore the folder '.idea'
- I used Pycharm to program, and Pycharm created this folder.

I'm happy to receive your feedback!
